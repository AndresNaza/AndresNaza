### Hi there, I'm Andres ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist. Curious by nature, I believe in the power of asking the right questions. 

Passionate about blockchain and data related technologies. Enthusiastic about the value that organizations can gain from the digital transformation.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning smart contract development with Solidity

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate and help with any data analysis and blockchain related project

- âš¡ Fun fact: Have you realized the way in which the digital transformation has shaped our lives? From business, to health, entertainment, sports, and even money, it's a beautiful moment to be alive, learn, help and enjoy this wonderful ride!
